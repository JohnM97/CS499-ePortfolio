# CS 499 ePortfolio ‚Äî John Munguia

## Professional Self-Assessment (Introduction)

As I complete my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University, this ePortfolio serves as both an academic capstone and a professional introduction. Throughout the program, I have built a strong foundation in software engineering, databases, data structures, algorithms, and secure coding, while also developing the collaboration and communication skills necessary to succeed in industry.

Working in Agile and Scrum environments taught me how to contribute to team goals, lead ceremonies, and adapt quickly to feedback. I gained experience translating stakeholder needs into clear technical requirements and producing maintainable solutions. From implementing efficient data structures to designing modular middleware for a full stack application, I learned to prioritize clarity, scalability, and security in my work. My embedded systems and secure coding projects further strengthened my ability to write reliable, safe software under real constraints.

This portfolio highlights three enhanced artifacts in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases that collectively demonstrate my technical range. Together, they reflect my growth as a developer who can solve problems thoughtfully and work effectively across the software development lifecycle. Completing this program while working full time also taught me resilience, time management, and a commitment to continuous learning, qualities I will carry into my career as a computer scientist.
