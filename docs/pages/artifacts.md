title: Artifacts & Narratives
permalink: /pages/artifacts.html

This section of my ePortfolio highlights three enhanced artifacts that represent core areas of computer science: **software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases**. All three artifacts originate from my CS 465 full stack project, *Travlr Getaways*, a MEAN stack travel booking application. Each artifact has been improved to showcase my growth in applying industry best practices and delivering professional-quality code.

### Software Design & Engineering  
**[View Narrative →](artifact-software.html)**  
Refactored the Express server entry point into modular middleware, improving maintainability, readability, and security. Demonstrates my ability to structure back-end applications for clarity and scalability.  

---

### Algorithms & Data Structures  
**[View Narrative →](artifact-algorithms.html)**  
Enhanced the Angular `Trip` interface with stronger typing and alignment to the database schema. Highlights my understanding of data structures, type safety, and consistency across the full stack.  

---

### Databases  
**[View Narrative →](artifact-databases.html)**  
Upgraded the MongoDB `Trip` schema by converting weakly typed fields to numbers, adding indexing, and enforcing validation. Demonstrates my ability to design efficient, reliable, and production-ready database models.

## Summary  

Together, these artifacts show my ability to work across the **full stack**:  
- Structuring **server code** with modular middleware  
- Strengthening **data models** for integrity and performance  
- Ensuring **consistent, type-safe structures** between the database, back end, and front end  

These improvements illustrate not only technical growth but also my readiness to apply computer science principles to real-world software projects.
