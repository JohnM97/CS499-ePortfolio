title: Artifacts & Narratives
permalink: /pages/artifacts.html
---

This section of my ePortfolio highlights three enhanced artifacts that represent core areas of computer science: **software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases**.  
All three artifacts originate from my CS 465 full stack project, *Travlr Getaways*, a MEAN stack travel booking application.  
Each artifact has been improved to showcase my growth in applying industry best practices and delivering professional-quality code.

**[View Artifact & Narrative →](artifact-software.html)**  
Refactored the Express server entry point in `app.js` into modular middleware, improving maintainability, readability, and security. Demonstrates my ability to structure back-end applications for clarity and scalability.

**[View Artifact & Narrative →](artifact-algorithms.html)**  
Enhanced the Angular `trip-listing.component.ts` to strengthen type safety and improve consistency with the database schema. Highlights my understanding of data structures, type safety, and consistency across the full stack.

**[View Artifact & Narrative →](artifact-databases.html)**  
Upgraded the MongoDB `travlr.js` schema with strong typing, indexing, custom validators, and virtuals. Demonstrates my ability to design efficient, reliable, and production-ready database models.

## Summary  

Together, these artifacts show my ability to work across the **full stack**:  
- Structuring **server code** with modular middleware  
- Strengthening **data models** for integrity and performance  
- Ensuring **consistent, type-safe structures** between the database, back end, and front end  

These improvements illustrate not only technical growth but also my readiness to apply computer science principles to real-world software projects.
