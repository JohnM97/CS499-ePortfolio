As I complete my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University, this ePortfolio represents the culmination of my academic work and a foundation for my professional career. Developing this portfolio has allowed me to showcase not only the technical skills I gained throughout the program but also the professional values and goals that shape the kind of developer I aim to be. Completing the capstone course and enhancing my artifacts has reinforced how far I have come in applying theory to practice and prepared me to contribute meaningfully in a professional software engineering role.

One of the greatest strengths I developed through the program has been the ability to work effectively in collaborative environments. In my full stack coursework, I worked extensively with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) to build a travel booking application. This required me to design both the front end and back end, create and refine database schemas, handle user authentication, and implement modular middleware for maintainability. Through this work, I gained firsthand experience with the complete software development lifecycle, from initial requirements gathering to deployment. These projects taught me the importance of clean architecture, scalability, and building solutions that respond to real user needs.

Communication with stakeholders was another critical area of growth. In the full stack project, I translated user stories into functional requirements, implemented requested features, and provided documentation that explained design decisions. Writing a software design document, creating system diagrams, and walking through code reviews all strengthened my ability to explain complex ideas clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences. This skill will help me bridge the gap between engineering teams and business stakeholders in a professional setting.

The program also gave me a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, databases, and secure coding practices. For example, I implemented efficient course data management using vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees in my algorithms coursework, while my database work emphasized schema validation, indexing, and relational integrity. In secure coding and software testing, I practiced exception handling, unit testing, and test-driven development to ensure that applications are both reliable and safe. While full stack development was my primary focus, working with embedded systems also gave me exposure to lower-level problem-solving. On the Raspberry Pi, I configured UART and GPIO to interact with hardware devices, which deepened my understanding of how software interacts with real-world systems and reinforced the importance of performance and reliability.

This portfolio highlights three enhanced artifacts in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each artifact demonstrates a different dimension of my growth. My software engineering enhancement showcases improvements to backend architecture and modular middleware. My algorithms and data structures enhancement demonstrates multiple implementations for efficient data storage and retrieval. My database enhancement highlights careful schema design and data validation for consistency and accuracy. Together, these artifacts illustrate my ability to design, build, and refine full stack solutions while keeping performance, maintainability, and security in mind.

Ultimately, completing this program while working full time has taught me perseverance, time management, and the value of continuous improvement. This ePortfolio reflects not only my technical expertise but also my professional readiness. It serves as both an academic milestone and a career tool, one that demonstrates to future employers that I am capable, adaptable, and eager to contribute as a full stack developer and software engineer.
