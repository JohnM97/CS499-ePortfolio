Full Stack Development with MEAN

Throughout this full stack project, I worked with several types of frontend development including basic Express HTML, standard JavaScript, and Angular as a Single Page Application (SPA). Early in the project, the Express HTML pages were simple, traditional server-rendered pages. Later, using Angular allowed for a much richer user experience where data could update dynamically without reloading the page. This shift made the application much faster and more modern. On the backend, we used a NoSQL MongoDB database because its flexible, document-based structure made it easy to store and manage data like trips, users, and authentication tokens without needing a fixed schema.

JSON played a critical role in tying together the frontend and backend. While JavaScript runs the logic in the browser, JSON acts as the format to transfer data between the server and client. For example, when a trip was created or updated, the frontend sent JSON data to the backend API, which then interacted with the database. During development, I refactored several parts of the code to improve functionality and make components reusable, such as the trip-card component in Angular. This not only made the code cleaner but allowed me to display trip data consistently across different parts of the app without rewriting the same logic.

Testing the API endpoints required using tools like Postman to send GET, POST, and PUT requests to ensure data was properly handled. Once authentication and security were added, it became more difficult because requests needed a valid JWT token to succeed. I learned that understanding HTTP methods, protected endpoints, and how to pass authentication tokens correctly is essential for maintaining a secure and fully functioning full stack application.

This course has helped me grow a lot toward reaching my professional goals. I have strengthened my skills in building real-world full stack applications, managing databases, securing APIs, and writing maintainable frontend code. I've learned to be comfortable working across both frontend and backend environments, and I feel more confident presenting myself as a strong candidate for web development or software engineering positions after this experience.
